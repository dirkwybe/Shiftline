Shiftline - Project Summary (Feature-Only Prompt)

Goal
Create a polished, portrait-first mobile puzzle game called “Shiftline.” The experience should feel premium, readable on phones, and easy to learn with satisfying progression.

Core Gameplay
- The game uses a grid-based board with colored blocks, walls, and colored holes.
- Players swipe to move an entire row or column; blocks slide until blocked.
- When a block reaches a same-colored hole, it locks in place.
- The puzzle is solved when all holes are filled with matching blocks.
- Input should be responsive and locked during animations or auto-solving.

Visuals & Feedback
- Clear, readable blocks and holes with strong color identity.
- Holes should look like recessed sockets (depth cue) while preserving color.
- Solved blocks should be visually distinct (subtle pulse + bright marker).
- Win celebration with a centered “Stage Clear!” banner and confetti.
- Sound and light haptic feedback on moves and wins.

Levels & Progression
- 100 levels grouped into 10 stages (10 levels each).
- Stage 1: 4 very easy, 4 easy, 2 challenging.
- Stages 2–10: 5 challenging, 4 hard, 1 very hard per stage.
- Progress unlocks stages in order; stage/level select screens reflect progress.
