Stage difficulty rules

Structure
- 10 stages total
- 10 levels per stage
- Within a stage: difficulty increases from level 1 to level 10

Stage 1 (intro)
- Levels 1-4: easy
- Levels 5-8: fun
- Levels 9-10: challenging

Stages 2-10
- Levels 1-5: challenging
- Levels 6-9: hard
- Level 10: hard+

Global rule
- Easy levels appear only in Stage 1.

Hard+ definition
- Use "hard" label, but ensure highest par_per_block and strict ordering
- Multiple interdependencies and at least one multi-swipe block

Placement rules
- Do not place a level where any block starts already solved.
- Prefer variety in mechanics per stage (walls, bouncers, holes placement).
- Par should generally rise within the stage.

Notes
- These are ordering rules, not automatic labels.
- Manual overrides are allowed but should be noted in JSON.
