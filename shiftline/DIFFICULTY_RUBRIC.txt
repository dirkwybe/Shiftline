Difficulty rubric (manual classification)

Definitions
- blocks: number of colored blocks in the level
- par_moves: minimum moves required to solve (solver par)
- par_per_block: par_moves / blocks
- ordering:
  - none: blocks can be solved in any order
  - specific: at least one block must be solved before another (soft dependency)
  - strict: multiple dependencies; order matters and mis-ordering blocks progress
- multi_swipe: at least one block needs 2+ swipes to solve

Classification
Easy
- Blocks: 1-4
- multi_swipe: no (single swipe per block)
- ordering: any (if all blocks solve in 1 swipe, it is easy)
- par_per_block: <= 2.0

Fun
- Blocks: 1-3
- multi_swipe: yes (at least one block needs 2+ swipes)
- ordering: none
- par_per_block: <= 2.5

Challenging
- Blocks: 1-4
- multi_swipe: yes (at least one block needs 2+ swipes)
- ordering: specific or strict
- par_per_block: <= 2.5

Hard
- Blocks: 1-4
- multi_swipe: yes (at least one block needs 2+ swipes)
- ordering: strict
- par_per_block: > 2.5

Sublevel within a tier
- Primary: par_per_block (higher = harder)
- Secondary: total par_moves
- Tertiary: dependency count (more dependencies = harder)

Tie-breakers
- If par_per_block is borderline, use ordering (strict > specific > none).
- If still unclear, use blocks count (more blocks = harder).

Notes
- Use the dev difficulty dropdown to set the label.
- If you override a level manually, set the manual flag in JSON.
